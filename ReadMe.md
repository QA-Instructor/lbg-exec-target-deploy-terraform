You need to create a service account key in the GCP Project
Go to IAM & Admin -> Service Accounts
Compute Engine default service account
Add key
Ensure it is a JSON key
It should download to your device

Copy it to your Terraform scripts folder
Edit the top of main.tf to point to the key

Edit the script as necessary e.g. Cohort numbers and count quantity

Ensure you are in the Terraform scripts directory:

terraform init 
terraform plan
terraform apply
terraform destroy # once finished with the resources

You will need to up your quota for IP addresses.

You will see this error: 
Error: Error waiting for instance to create: Quota 'IN_USE_ADDRESSES' exceeded.  Limit: 8.0 in region europe-west1.

Request more (approx 25) in the region your script is uing e.g. europe-west1

To troubleshoot the start-up script look at the logs: cat /var/log/syslog
